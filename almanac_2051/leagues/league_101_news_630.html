						It was a terrific day for <a href="../players/player_19441.html">Alex Arriaga</a> of the <a href="../teams/team_128.html">Kimberly Raiders</a> at Raiders Ballpark today. The left-hander stood out with a fantastic 3-0 no-hitter against the <a href="../teams/team_140.html">Cross Plains Northmen</a>.<br><br>"I knew I had a no-no going in about the sixth inning when I noticed no one was talking to me anymore," he said, referring to the time-honored superstition of avoiding the pitcher so as not to jinx the no-hitter. "Don't let people fool you. Everybody on the field and in the ballpark knows what's happening. They just pretend they don't."<br><br>For the game, <a href="../players/player_19441.html">Arriaga</a> totaled 2 walks and 9 strikeouts in a very strong outing.<br><br>"His mechanics were perfect, and I don't think he threw one bad pitch in the whole game," Kimberly manager Jeremy Berg said. "He was that good."<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_19441.html">Arriaga</a> has fanned 65 in 66.2 innings and collected a 5-1 record with a 1.21 ERA. <br><br><a href="../game_logs/log_5700.html">View Game Log</a>
