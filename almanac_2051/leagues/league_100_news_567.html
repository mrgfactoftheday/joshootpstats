						In a dominant outing, <a href="../players/player_19426.html">Mario Garcia</a> of the <a href="../teams/team_42.html">Eau Claire Seafarers</a> totally silenced the bats of the <a href="../teams/team_55.html">Barron Smokies</a>, finishing with a no-hitter.<br><br>In the Seafarers' 2-0 victory, Garcia faced only 28 batters, surrendered no hits, had 4 strikeouts and 2 walks.<br><br>"Honestly, I didn't even know the situation was what it was until the seventh inning," Eau Claire manager Greg Harrison said. "I happened to look up there to see how many hits we had gotten, and I happened to notice that they hadn't gotten any."<br><br>Commenting on the defeat, losing manager <a href="../coaches/coach_1277.html">Ramon Maya</a> told reporters in the clubhouse that he had a "pretty simple" analysis of the game.<br><br>"The Seafarers had all the hits and all the runs, so they won," he snapped. "But yeah, Garcia pitched a heck of a ballgame."<br><br>Thus far this season, <a href="../players/player_19426.html">Garcia</a> has tossed 59.2 innings in 8 starts, fanned 41 batters, walked 9 and put up a 1.36 ERA with 5 wins and 1 loss.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_2285.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_2285.html">View Game Log</a>
