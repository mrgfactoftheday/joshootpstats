						With the final, flawless out recorded, the <a href="../teams/team_44.html">Washburn Prospects</a> piled onto <a href="../players/player_16463.html">Trent Walker</a> at the center of the Surf Ballpark diamond. Walker joined baseball's most hallowed club today, completing a perfect game against the <a href="../teams/team_39.html">Calumet Surf</a>.<br><br>The 28-year-old left-hander kept the Calumet offense guessing all day long and with some help from the defenders behind him, etched his name into the record books with the 1-0 shutout.<br><br>"His breaking pitches had more movement than I've ever seen from Trent," Washburn manager Jose Rivera said in the postgame interview. "He made everyone's job easy today. He just saw a target and he hit it. Simple as that."<br><br>For the game, Walker retired all 27 batters he faced and fanned 9 of them. He walked none and nobody got on base.<br><br>His record this year is 5-1 in 6 starts and <a href="../players/player_16463.html">Walker</a> has a 0.41 ERA.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_2138.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_2138.html">View Game Log</a>
