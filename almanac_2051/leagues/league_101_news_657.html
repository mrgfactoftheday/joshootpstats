						"It's worse than we thought." That was the news from the Maroons clubhouse today as it was learned that starting pitcher <a href="../players/player_19684.html">Kyung-hwan Lee</a> will be out for an added 6 days as a result of a recent injury. His treatment for back spasms will have to be extended. Initially it didn't seem the injury was a major concern, but the <a href="../teams/team_141.html">Black River Falls</a> starting pitcher told team trainers of some discomfort yesterday morning, and upon examination it was determined to be a more serious injury. "We'd rather take this thing slowly and make sure <a href="../players/player_19684.html">Kyung-hwan</a> gets back onto the field healthy," said the team's head trainer. <br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_19684.html">Lee</a> has worked 68.1 innings with 13 strikeouts en route to a 3-6 record and a 2.37 ERA.
