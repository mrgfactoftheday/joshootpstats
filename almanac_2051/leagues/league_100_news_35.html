						Wisconsin Baseball League divulged the 2050 list of eligible draftees today. It got little play in BNN coverage and why should it? Most players drafted in thirty days won't be on a big league club for years, if at all. Some will languish listlessly at the minor league level. Others will suffer a series of misfortunes, never quite making their mark, but always wowing scouts with their potential. And yet, some lucky team will draw a needle out of a haystack, send him off to the minors and forget about him for a while, only to realize they've got a Hall of Famer on their hands.<br><br>At any rate, teams now have thirty days to scout the draft pool prior to the draft. The Transactions page also gets a new section dedicated to the pool.<br><br>The early favorites to be high picks are the following:<br>1. <a href="../players/player_21607.html">Adam Duda</a>, 21 year-old LHP out of high-school.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_21618.html">Ed Hatton</a>, 21 year-old SS out of high-school.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_22032.html">Jason Cranson</a>, 37 year-old SS out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_21525.html">Paul Kowal</a>, 21 year-old 2B out of high-school.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_22451.html">Curt Dorman</a>, 20 year-old RHP out of high-school.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_22894.html">Russ Croft</a>, 37 year-old 2B out of college.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_21550.html">Nick Miller</a>, 21 year-old LHP out of high-school.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_21588.html">Nate Rochon</a>, 21 year-old SS out of high-school.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_22469.html">Alvaro Munoz</a>, 21 year-old LHP out of high-school.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_21628.html">Brandon Gray</a>, 21 year-old CF out of high-school.<br><br>The official OSA Mock Draft will be released on the day of the draft, or you can review the draft pool on the draft page.
