						5 hits in a game is a rare thing, but <a href="../teams/team_125.html">Coleman</a>'s <a href="../players/player_19113.html">Andy Torres</a> made it happen today against the Steelheads. Everything came together at the plate for the 26-year-old catcher as he collected 5 hits in 7 at-bats -- and led the Airhogs to a 4-1 win at Steelheads Ballpark. <br><br>"I'm just out there to try and help the team win," Torres said after the game, "I had some real good at-bats today. I made good, solid contact and luckily no one caught 'em." <br><br><a href="../players/player_19113.html">Andy Torres</a> hit an RBI double in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, singled in the 5th, singled in the 8th, flied out in the 9th, grounded out in the 11th and hit a two-run double in the 13th.<br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_19113.html">Torres</a> has banged out 19 hits in 99 at-bats for a .192 average with 1 home run. He is getting on base at a .252 pace and his totals also include 8 RBIs and 8 runs scored.<br><br><a href="../game_logs/log_5168.html">View Game Log</a>
