						It began like any other game, but by the seventh inning everybody in Big Cats Ballpark knew history was in the making.<br><br>When the last out was recorded, <a href="../players/player_19638.html">Todd Oldham</a> of the <a href="../teams/team_35.html">Brown Red Dragons</a> had indeed made history with a perfect game against the <a href="../teams/team_34.html">Chippewa Big Cats</a>. He beat them 3-0, yielded no hits, no walks and no baserunners in his historic outing.<br><br>Throughout the game, Oldham was electric, handing out 10 Ks to a shocked Big Cats offense en route to a day he will always remember.<br><br>"Don't let anybody kid you," he told reporters after the game. "You know when it's a no-hitter. You can see the big 'zero' on the scoreboard. But I didn't realize no one had even gotten on base until late, which made it even worse. I didn't want to lose a perfect game in the last inning. Luckily I was in a fog during the last three hitters and the pressure didn't faze me. I guess ignorance is bliss."<br><br>For the season <a href="../players/player_19638.html">Oldham</a> has compiled a 3-1 record with a 2.14 ERA.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_2566.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_2566.html">View Game Log</a>
