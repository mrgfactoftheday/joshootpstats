						<a href="../coaches/coach_230.html">Troy Lieberman</a> has molded the <a href="../teams/team_13.html">Wallworth Thunder Cats</a> into a top-flight Southern Counties team.

I told them to learn my system and we would win. I told them all the spots on the roster were open, that the best players would play -- young or old, rookie or vet -- and that I expected them to hustle, to work hard, and play as a team. They bought into it and made me look good."<br><br>And <a href="../coaches/coach_230.html">Troy Lieberman</a> certainly got the most out of his ballclub. The Thunder Cats wrapped up the season in first place in the Southern Counties District 1,4,5 with a 64-36 record.
