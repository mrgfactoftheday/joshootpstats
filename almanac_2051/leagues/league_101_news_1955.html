						When <a href="../coaches/coach_810.html">Venceslau Gralhez</a> was hired to lead the <a href="../teams/team_138.html">Ripon Orcas</a>, fans were expecting improvement over the last manager. Today, flanked by team officials, <a href="../coaches/coach_810.html">Gralhez</a> accepted the Sub League 2 Manager of the Year Award, noting the level of passion for the <a href="../teams/team_138.html">Ripon Orcas</a>.<br><br>"The biggest challenge was the fans. I don't know how many times I was asked, if I thought the club was good enough. It was as if they expected failure. It was much easier to win over the ballplayers. Slowly but surely the fans began to believe in us."<br><br><a href="../coaches/coach_810.html">Gralhez</a> led <a href="../teams/team_138.html">Ripon</a> to a first place finish in the Sub League 2 Division 2. The Orcas ended up with a 55-25 record.<br><br><a href="../coaches/coach_810.html">Gralhez</a> is looking forward to the offseason. "We're reviewing our options. You never stand still in baseball. You either get better or worse, 'cause everyone else is out to get your free agents or deal for your prospects. It's going to be a challenge." But the skipper has more than proven he is equal to the task.
