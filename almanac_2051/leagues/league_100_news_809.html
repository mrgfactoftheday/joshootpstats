						It was a terrific day for <a href="../players/player_21083.html">Pascal Le Roy</a> of the <a href="../teams/team_13.html">Wallworth Thunder Cats</a> at Wallworth Fields today. The left-hander stood out with a fantastic 3-0 no-hitter against the <a href="../teams/team_1.html">Dane Maples</a>.<br><br>"I knew I had a no-no going in about the sixth inning when I noticed no one was talking to me anymore," he said, referring to the time-honored superstition of avoiding the pitcher so as not to jinx the no-hitter. "Don't let people fool you. Everybody on the field and in the ballpark knows what's happening. They just pretend they don't."<br><br>For the game, <a href="../players/player_21083.html">Le Roy</a> totaled 1 walk and 4 strikeouts in a very strong outing.<br><br>"His mechanics were perfect, and I don't think he threw one bad pitch in the whole game," Wallworth manager Troy Lieberman said. "He was that good."<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_21083.html">Le Roy</a> has a 4-2 record and a 1.89 ERA.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_1088.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_1088.html">View Game Log</a>
