						Of the many memorable accomplishments in the career of <a href="../teams/team_107.html">Rib Mountain Night Hawks</a> pitcher <a href="../players/player_18189.html">Manuel Ortiz</a>, none will likely compare to the outing he had against <a href="../teams/team_120.html">Bloomer</a> today at Night Hawks Ballpark. Ortiz was perfect, retiring every batter he faced to give his team the 1-0 victory over the Revolution.<br><br>"That shows you the kind of competitor he is," Rib Mountain manager T.J. Holloway said. "I thought he dominated the whole game. He hit his spots well and was really focused out there."<br><br>He finished the game with 10 strikeouts, walked no one, gave up no hits and his teammates made no errors. He retired all 27 batters he faced.<br><br>"I had command of my pitches from the get-go," said Ortiz. "Usually it takes a few innings for me to get loose and get my mechanics right. It happened quicker today. I was comfortable from the first pitch. As the innings went on, it got easier. I was really smooth, fluid and relaxed. And the team definitely had my back."<br><br><br><br><a href="../game_logs/log_4242.html">View Game Log</a>
