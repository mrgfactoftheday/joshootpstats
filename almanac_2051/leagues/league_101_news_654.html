						The <a href="../teams/team_130.html">Baldwin Highlanders</a> have their share of problems, but getting to the postseason isn't one of them. The club today clinched the Sub League 2 Division 4 crown.<br><br>"It's not a perfect clubhouse, we have issues just like any other team, but in the end we did what we had to do on the field," said starting pitcher <a href="../players/player_19244.html">Gabriel Lincoln</a>. "In the end, it's a roster of guys coming together for the same cause."<br><br>Team manager <a href="../coaches/coach_941.html">Tyler Stacy</a> brushed off any suggestions there are issues in his clubhouse and said he's proud of his team.<br><br>"Anything that goes on, it's just regular stuff that any team would deal with," he said. "In the end, we won the division and that's all that matters."<br><br>The club has a 46-32 record and the division title is their 3rd.
