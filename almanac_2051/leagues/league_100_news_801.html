						<a href="../players/player_19015.html">Tom Martin</a> is hurting again, just a few days into his treatment for a knee contusion. Apparently the injury worsened, so the Fighting Scots sent the 27-year-old left fielder back to the doctors for reexamination. <a href="../players/player_19015.html">Martin</a> told them that the pain had gotten much worse in recent days. It was confirmed that the injury was indeed much more severe that first thought. He was sent to a specialist, who felt that treatment would be longer than first diagnosed. <a href="../players/player_19015.html">Martin</a> will now miss a minimum of 5 days.<br><br>In his season totals, <a href="../players/player_19015.html">Martin</a> has no home runs, .237 BA, .313 OBP, 13 RBIs and 12 runs scored. He has played in 45 games.
