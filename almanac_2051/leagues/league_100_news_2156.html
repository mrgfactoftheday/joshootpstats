						The stakes were high at Sharks Ballpark tonight and the <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Waushara Sharks</a> stepped up when it counted.<br><br>Edging the <a href="../teams/team_30.html">Iowa Ravens</a> 4-3 to wrap up the League Finals, Waushara won the clinching game by a 2-0 score.<br><br>"You've got to fight that doubt and that little part of you that says you can't do it or you're going to fail," said Waushara right-hander <a href="../players/player_20652.html">Marco Flores</a>. "The possibility of failure is always in your mind, but you can't let it bring you down."<br><br>The failure of the Ravens to advance was certainly weighing heavily on the team's manager.<br><br>"It's a crushing loss and a tough way to lose a series," <a href="../coaches/coach_1258.html">Kevin Vespucci</a> said. "In the end there can only be one Championship champion and we're just devastated it's not going to be us."<br><br>Flores's strong pitching earned him the nod as series MVP. He had a 0.00 ERA over 14 innings pitched. He added 19 strikeouts with a 2-0 record.<br><br>The Championship matchups and schedule will be announced after the League Finals finishes.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_7226.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_7226.html">View Game Log</a>
