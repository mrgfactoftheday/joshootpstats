"I happened to look up there to see how many hits we had gotten, and I happened to notice that they hadn't gotten any."<br><br>Commenting on the defeat, losing manager <a href="../coaches/coach_957.html">John Gould</a> told reporters in the clubhouse that he had a "pretty simple" analysis of the game.<br><br>"The Cowboys had all the hits and all the runs, so they won," he snapped. "But yeah, Richardson pitched a heck of a ballgame."<br><br><br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_244.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_244.html">View Game Log</a>
