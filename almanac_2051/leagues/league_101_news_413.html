He went to the plate 7 times and 5 times he delivered base hits, but his club still suffered a 3-2 defeat.<br><br>"Not much I can say," offered <a href="../players/player_17680.html">Clow</a> in the postgame press conference. "I got a bunch of hits, but it would have been much better to get a win. Can I trade 5 hits for the win?" <br><br><a href="../players/player_17680.html">Timothy Clow</a> singled in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, grounded out in the 5th, singled in the 8th, struck out in the 10th, singled in the 13th and singled in the 15th.<br><br><br><br><a href="../game_logs/log_3731.html">View Game Log</a>
