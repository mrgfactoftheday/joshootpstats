"There was only one thing that mattered and that was to get us the win. It makes it worth all the hard work to be able to knock Dane out and move on to the League Semi-Finals."<br><br> For the series, <a href="../players/player_20078.html">McKnight</a> had a 0.00 ERA over 2.1 innings pitched, with 4 strikeouts and a 2-0 record.<br><br>The League Semi-Finals matchups and schedule will be announced after the Divisional Round finishes.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_7196.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_7196.html">View Game Log</a>
