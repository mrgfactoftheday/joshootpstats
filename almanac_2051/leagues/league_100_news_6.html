						Today was a historic day that <a href="../players/player_6372.html">Jordan Alcaraz</a> will never forget. The superb pitcher was inducted into the Wisconsin Baseball League Hall of Fame alongside the great baseball immortals of the past. <br><br>He was introduced by one of his former managers, who said, "He was the best I have seen in my lifetime. <a href="../players/player_6372.html">Jordan</a> was a fabulous pitcher. The key to his success was that he threw the ball as far from the bat and as close to the plate as possible."<br><br>The talented pitcher retired from baseball at 40, but not before he amassed 131 victories. In his illustrious career, <a href="../players/player_6372.html">Jordan Alcaraz</a> was 131-95 with a 1.72 ERA. He made 386 mound appearances and struck out 1749 in 2114.2 innings.<br><br><a href="../players/player_6372.html">Alcaraz</a> brought down the house with his closing remarks. "This is really a sad day for me. I've never had a job. I've always played baseball. I guess I'll have to go to work now."
