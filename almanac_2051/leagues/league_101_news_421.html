						<a href="../players/player_17628.html">Rhys Scud</a> was feeling calm about his no-hitter -- until the last three outs.<br><br>"You really become conscious of every pitch at that point," he said. "The adrenaline level kicks up even higher. Everybody in the ballpark knows a no-hitter is on the line. The crowd is on its feet. One mistake and it's all over."<br><br>There were no mistakes to be had for Scud on this day at Ballpark of Black Creek. The <a href="../teams/team_98.html">Viroqua Red Claws</a> right-hander was in complete command, not allowing the <a href="../teams/team_97.html">Black Creek Cowboys</a> a single base hit in the 5-0 victory.<br><br>"Obviously, you never think this will happen," he said to BNN reporters after the game. "I don't know if it's really sunk in yet."<br><br>Scud faced 31 batters, had 8 strikeouts and gave up 2 walks in a dominating effort.<br><br>"He was on from the get-go," Cowboys manager <a href="../coaches/coach_1114.html">Nick Grinnell</a> said. "He was hitting his spots and keeping us off balance. It was a great game by him."<br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_17628.html">Scud</a> has claimed 1 save and registered a 1-1 record with a 1.88 ERA. He has 12 relief appearances spanning 28.2 innings and has struck out 30.<br><br><a href="../game_logs/log_3753.html">View Game Log</a>
