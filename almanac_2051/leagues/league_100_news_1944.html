						<a href="../players/player_20547.html">Shunji Ushijima</a> was feeling calm about his no-hitter -- until the last three outs.<br><br>"You really become conscious of every pitch at that point," he said. "The adrenaline level kicks up even higher. Everybody in the ballpark knows a no-hitter is on the line. The crowd is on its feet. One mistake and it's all over."<br><br>There were no mistakes to be had for Ushijima on this day at Ballpark of Outagamie. The <a href="../teams/team_66.html">Burnett Spikes</a> right-hander was in complete command, not allowing the <a href="../teams/team_63.html">Outagamie Vikings</a> a single base hit in the 6-0 victory.<br><br>"Obviously, you never think this will happen," he said to BNN reporters after the game. "I don't know if it's really sunk in yet."<br><br>Ushijima faced 33 batters, had 4 strikeouts and gave up 4 walks in a dominating effort.<br><br>"He was on from the get-go," Vikings manager <a href="../coaches/coach_783.html">Nicolas Moreno</a> said. "He was hitting his spots and keeping us off balance. It was a great game by him."<br><br>In season stats <a href="../players/player_20547.html">Ushijima</a> shows a 7-2 record in 15 games, 87.2 innings, 59 strikeouts and a 1.95 ERA.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_6047.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_6047.html">View Game Log</a>
