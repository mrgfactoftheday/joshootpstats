						<a href="../players/player_21394.html">Cole Younger</a> is hanging up his spikes at the end of the season.<br><br>Younger, a 38-year-old veteran, told the <a href="../teams/team_112.html">Greenwood Speed Devils</a> that he will be retiring.<br><br>"I loved playing a kid's game and getting paid well to do it. I loved the travel and the attention ballplayers get," he said. "But, what I'm really going to miss are a lot of the little things that go on behind the scenes. I'm going to miss playing on perfectly mowed grass each day. That's our stage, and a bunch of anonymous groundskeepers made that happen each week."<br><br>The native of Antigo, Wisconsin showed an obvious love for the game as he reflected on the sport.<br><br>"My bat representative ... I would talk to him and next thing I'd have brand new bats. I loved the perfectly straight chalk lines, the echoes from the PA system, and even the umps."
