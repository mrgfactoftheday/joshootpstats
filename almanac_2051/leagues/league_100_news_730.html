						Over the course of baseball history, some moments stand a little taller than others. One of those moments happened today at Wallworth Fields.<br><br><a href="../teams/team_13.html">Wallworth</a> right-hander <a href="../players/player_19579.html">John McGowen</a> threw a perfect game at as the Thunder Cats beat the <a href="../teams/team_16.html">Vernon Browns</a>, 1-0. In his post-game comments, <a href="../players/player_19579.html">McGowen</a> told reporters that it was something he had never dreamed of.<br><br>"As a kid, you always think of pitching to win the final game of a championship," <a href="../players/player_19579.html">McGowen</a> said. "You never think of pitching a perfect game, because it just seems unattainable. I'll remember this day for the rest of my life."<br><br>By the end of the game, McGowen had rung up 10 <a href="../teams/team_16.html">Vernon</a> hitters on strikeouts, and did not allow a single baserunner. The fans gave McGowen a standing ovation as he left the mound, knowing they had witnessed one of the rarest events in the sport. <br><br>On the year <a href="../players/player_19579.html">McGowen</a> has worked 30.2 innings with 30 strikeouts en route to a 2-0 record and 1.76 ERA.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_827.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_827.html">View Game Log</a>
