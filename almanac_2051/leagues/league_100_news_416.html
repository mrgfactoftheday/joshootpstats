						The scouting reports are in. Baseball officials have spent endless hours, days and weeks debating and agonizing over which first-year players should be drafted. Some guys do it scientifically, while the grizzled old pros go by gut feel. Whatever the team's philosophy, the Wisconsin Baseball League amateur draft is today and these ballclubs have the first five selections: <a href="../teams/team_60.html">Clark</a>, <a href="../teams/team_46.html">Oconto</a>, <a href="../teams/team_39.html">Calumet</a>, <a href="../teams/team_24.html">Kenosha</a> and <a href="../teams/team_16.html">Vernon</a>. It is the consensus among the baseball journalists and experts that these guys will go in the first ten picks:<br><br><br>1. <a href="../players/player_21607.html">Adam Duda</a>, 21 year-old LHP out of high-school.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_21618.html">Ed Hatton</a>, 21 year-old SS out of high-school.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_22032.html">Jason Cranson</a>, 37 year-old SS out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_21525.html">Paul Kowal</a>, 21 year-old 2B out of high-school.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_22451.html">Curt Dorman</a>, 21 year-old RHP out of high-school.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_21550.html">Nick Miller</a>, 21 year-old LHP out of high-school.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_21628.html">Brandon Gray</a>, 21 year-old CF out of high-school.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_21588.html">Nate Rochon</a>, 21 year-old SS out of high-school.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_22469.html">Alvaro Munoz</a>, 21 year-old LHP out of high-school.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_21637.html">Bobby Disher</a>, 21 year-old CF out of high-school.
