						"It's worse than we thought." That was the news from the Barbarians clubhouse today as it was learned that catcher <a href="../players/player_19843.html">Edgar Padilla</a> will be out for an added one week as a result of a recent injury. His treatment for back tightness will have to be extended. Initially it didn't seem the injury was a major concern, but the <a href="../teams/team_36.html">Oneida</a> catcher told team trainers of some discomfort yesterday morning, and upon examination it was determined to be a more serious injury. "We'd rather take this thing slowly and make sure <a href="../players/player_19843.html">Edgar</a> gets back onto the field healthy," said the team's head trainer. <br><br>Looking at his present stats, <a href="../players/player_19843.html">Padilla</a> has compiled a .184 batting average in 23 games with a .244 on-base percentage, while hitting 1 home run and driving in 3 runs.
