						For quite a few seasons <a href="../players/player_7377.html">Francisco McLennan</a> unnerved batters as one of the best pitchers around. Yesterday it was his day for the jitters. The talented twirler became a baseball immortal as he was enshrined into the Wisconsin Baseball League Hall of Fame.<br><br>"This is overwhelming, over the top. I can't put into words what this means," McLennan told the crowd that had gathered to honor him as baseball's newest legend. "You don't get to the Hall of Fame by yourself. I got here with the help of some great teammates, coaches and managers. One of the greatest lessons I learned was how to pitch from a hitter's perspective. That's when I became a better-than-average big league pitcher."<br><br><a href="../players/player_7377.html">Francisco McLennan</a> retired at 36 after a celebrated baseball career. He pitched in 334 games, compiled an impressive 108-70 won-lost record with a 1.64 ERA.
