						Both <a href="../players/player_17536.html">Elijah Mitchell</a> and his manager can't believe the <a href="../teams/team_141.html">Black River Falls</a> first baseman was suspended 2 games by the league commissioner for making contact with an umpire during yesterday's game against <a href="../teams/team_109.html">Marshall</a>.<br><br>Mitchell only said, "It's not right. I didn't bump him."<br><br>His manager was more colorful and told reporters today, "The suspension is outrageous. Arguments like this go on all the time. The suspension is totally uncalled for. In the heat of battle, there are going to be arguments," he said. "If they want to take that away, let's go to Sunday School and be choir boys."<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_17536.html">Mitchell</a> has socked 19 hits in 75 at-bats for a .253 average with 1 home run. He is getting on base at a .317 pace and his totals also include 8 RBIs and 3 runs scored.
