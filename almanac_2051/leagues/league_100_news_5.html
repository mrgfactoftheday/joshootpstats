						"He was steely-eyed and focused when he was on the mound. Batters had a little fear when they faced him... and you didn't dig in on him." That is how his manager described one of the best relief pitchers of all time at his Hall of Fame induction ceremony. "I never had any pitcher as good as <a href="../players/player_1492.html">Abel</a>. When he came into a close game, he did it."<br><br><a href="../players/player_1492.html">Abel Ekström</a> retired at the age of 43 and today became a member of baseball's elite in the Wisconsin Baseball League Hall of Fame.<br><br>In his speech he gave the secret of his success. "I learned an important lesson from my first baseball coach. He said if you take care of the basics, you will win more often than you lose. Batters had to swing at strikes. Outfielders had to religiously hit the cutoff man. Pitchers had to religiously throw strikes. If you didn't, he would yank you."<br><br><a href="../players/player_1492.html">Ekström</a> learned his lesson well. During his career, this remarkable bullpen specialist made 283 relief appearances with 96 saves, while recording a 83-33 mark. He put up a 1.22 ERA with 1216 strikeouts in 1193.1 innings and held other clubs to a .141 batting average.<br><br>Just your ordinary, everyday Hall of Fame numbers, folks... that's all.
