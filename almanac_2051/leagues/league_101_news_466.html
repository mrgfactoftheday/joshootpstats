						The no-hitter is one of baseball's truly egalitarian achievements. It's done by the great and the not-so-great alike, and for nearly all of them it represents the pinnacle of a career. <a href="../teams/team_133.html">Delafield Steelheads</a> pitcher <a href="../players/player_19286.html">Joe Creed</a> had his moment today at Steelheads Ballpark, holding the <a href="../teams/team_127.html">Ladysmith Scots</a> hitless and beating them, 9-0.<br><br>"Everything was working for him," Scots manager <a href="../coaches/coach_744.html">Sam Rhodes</a> said. "He had a lot of late movement that seemed to cause the guys trouble, especially from the fifth inning on.  He was in command."<br><br>Creed rung up 14 strikeouts, issued 1 walk and faced only 28 hitters in his historic outing. After the game, he spoke to BNN reporters in the Delafield locker room.<br><br>"I really got nervous in the last inning," Creed recalled. "I knew I had a chance at a no-hitter but it was hard to stay calm and concentrate. Thank goodness for my catcher. He told me he would do all the thinking and I could just concentrate on hitting his glove."<br><br><br><br><a href="../game_logs/log_5349.html">View Game Log</a>
