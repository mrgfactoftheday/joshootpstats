						It was a terrific day for <a href="../players/player_19921.html">Rafael Lopez</a> of the <a href="../teams/team_120.html">Bloomer Revolution</a> at Ballpark of Bloomer today. The right-hander stood out with a fantastic 1-0 no-hitter against the <a href="../teams/team_146.html">Mineral Point Magicians</a>.<br><br>"I knew I had a no-no going in about the sixth inning when I noticed no one was talking to me anymore," he said, referring to the time-honored superstition of avoiding the pitcher so as not to jinx the no-hitter. "Don't let people fool you. Everybody on the field and in the ballpark knows what's happening. They just pretend they don't."<br><br>For the game, <a href="../players/player_19921.html">Lopez</a> totaled 2 walks and 7 strikeouts in a very strong outing.<br><br>"His mechanics were perfect, and I don't think he threw one bad pitch in the whole game," Bloomer manager Jason Castle said. "He was that good."<br><br><br><br><a href="../game_logs/log_4227.html">View Game Log</a>
